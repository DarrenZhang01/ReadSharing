 - Project Introduction

Topic: 	
A reading commenting and communicating platform using open library API
			(API url: <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api">
            https://openlibrary.org/developers/api</a>)

Group:

		Chen Zhang, Zhibo Zhang, Ruichen Li


Basic Idea About our Project:

		This is an online reading commenting and communicating platform.
		Through our platform, users can search what ever books that are avalible on the
	open library. Once they get the search result, they are able to have a quick look
	at the brief introduction of that book. They can also reference the short review
	and grading written by our web users for that book. Through the short review, they
	can decide whether they want to borrow that book from the open library. After finishing
	reading one book, users can write their own short reviews and grade that book under
	the intoduction module of that book. What's more, there is a 'long review' or
	'book report' (something similar to blogs or articles) module for the users who read
	a same book to share their views about particular points, inspirement or enlightment
	or even some of their own thoughts from reading that book.
